# Autism-Spectrum-Detection
INTRODUCTION
ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is a condition that
affects children aged six to seventeen years old. Individuals
with ASD have issues with their social skills, behavioural
skills, and communication skills. Patients with ASD are much
more likely to exhibit abnormal social behaviour and
repetitive behaviour, which can negatively impact their
social experiences. According to the statistics given by WHO,
1 child in 160 children suffer with ASD. So, it becomes very
crucial to detect ASD at an early age, so the standard of
lifetime of children is also improved. The models for early
detection of ASD are supported functional and structural
relationships of human brains. Therefore FMRI (Functional
resonance Imaging), are utilized in the training of ASD
models, because it will be accustomed study structures of
brain and show the correlated fluctuations in BOLD (Blood
oxygen level-dependent) signals from different brain
regions. ABIDE is one among the foremost commonly used
dataset in training of models designed for detection of
autism. it's been observed that ASD affects the functional
connectivity between different regions of the brain. So
works are being done to spot ASD supported neural
patterns of functional connectivity. during this paper we've
got proposed a ASD detection model supported FMRI data,
that's able to detect ASD in subjects/patients.
